# **Rock Paper Scissors**

## **Overview:**

This is the Day 4 project from the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp. Itâ€™s a classic game where the player competes against the computer. The player chooses rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer makes a random choice. The game then determines and displays the winner based on the choices.

## **How It Works:**

1. **Player Choice:** The player selects between rock (0), paper (1), or scissors (2).
2. **Computer Choice:** The computer randomly picks rock, paper, or scissors.
3. **Outcome Determination:**
   - Rock beats scissors.
   - Paper beats rock.
   - Scissors beat paper.
   - If both choices are the same, it's a draw.
